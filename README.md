# Image_Classification - Potato Leaf Disease Classification

Disclaimer: Of course not a deep learning project. Click bait!! Haha..
The data we will be dealing with is similar to a normal Machine learning project. But this procedure can be implemented to large dataset as well.

Types of Potato Crop Diseases:
1. Early Blight
2. Late Blight
Steps for an End-to-end project:
1. Data collection — tf dataset, data augmentation
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Modeling — we use CNN
3.1. then export the trained model into our disk
3.2. we use MLops method like tf serving. tf serving will be called from fast API.
